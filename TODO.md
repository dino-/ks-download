- Fix "CITY BARBEQUE" match from 2015-07-16
- What's with the Match type? Why not have KS.Locate.Places.Match just return a KS.Data.Document?
- Make all tools that need to write files into directories capable of making those directories.
- Update and expand README.md
- Do we need ks-docdump and ks-dump any longer? Probably one of them can go.
- It may be time to put info in changelog.md
- Is there a different url encoding API than what's in Network.HTTP?
- ks-dlinsp
   - Failure to access the URL kills the whole process. Should we handle this with retrying somehow? Not sure
   - Should have much more/better logging

- Triangle potential population of Android users
- Add use case and caching info to the new wiki
   - use cases:
      - what's around a specific location
      - search for a specific restaurant
   - caching on the client:
      - ??
- Add msmtp installation notes to wiki
