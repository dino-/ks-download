- Write some usage docs in README.md
- It may be time to put info in changelog.md
- Look into accessing CouchBase directly from Haskell
- Is there a different url encoding API than what's in Network.HTTP?
- ks-inspections
   - Parameterize the start and end dates for querying the
     inspection data
- Ksdl.Inspection
   - Should we really be using Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 for
     saveInspection? Try with just Data.ByteString.Lazy or even
     not lazy.
- Ksdl.InspSource.*
   - Replace usage of Network.HTTP with Network.HTTP.Conduit
     (http-conduit). See Ksdl.Geocoding/Places
- Ksdl.Places.Match
   - Look at Beasley's 083aa, replace '/'s with spaces
      - Doesn't help, ["beasley's","chuck's"] fails
      - And anyway, it's completely shitty to not have both of
        these as separate inspections
   - More stopwords?!
