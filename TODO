- Change the main.downloader implementation into a (Map String
  Downloader) so it can be used in usage output
- Look into accessing CouchBase directly from Haskell
- Generate deterministic UUIDs for these records (using UUID v4
  instead of v5). See the uuid-example project for help on this.
- Write modules for loading data from the GEOCODE and Places
  results
- Need a transformer stack for errors, config, logging and IO
- Look for Places API key file in /etc/ as well as $HOME
- Replace usage of Network.HTTP with Network.Curl
- Is there a different url encoding API than with Network.HTTP?


in the short-term:

- Refactor all of this code into parts that are:
   - To become part of the production downloading tool
   - Are transient for this exercise
      - Places code is possibly going away
- Need possible string-similarity, longest substring, etc code
- Take state and zip off of ivic
- Need logging, especially for failure. Can't see where failures
  are happening at all now.
- Problem with "North Raleigh Courtyard.." 47ca55.. Getting no
  results from something. Possibly because of trademark
  symbol. Unicode problem?
