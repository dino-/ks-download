- ks-inspections
   - Change the main.downloader implementation into a (Map String
     Downloader) so it can be used in usage output
   - Do proper usage output
- ks-location
   - Look for Places API key file in /etc/ as well as $HOME
- Ksdl.Inspection
   - Should we really be using Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 for

     not lazy.
- Ksdl.InspSource.*
   - Replace usage of Network.HTTP with Network.HTTP.Conduit
     (http-conduit). See Ksdl.Geocoding/Places
