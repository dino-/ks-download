- Figure out what the top-level "tools" should be. What is the
  progression of tasks to go from nothing to inspections scraped to
  data inserted into the db?
- For above, need a set of dirs input or in Config that represent
  where data is coming from and going to.
- IMPORTANT: we are not saving or moving the inspection files from
  an input dir to a failed dir.
- When saving data files, use some prefix conventions, like:
   - insp_UUID.json  -- "raw" inspection data
   - ks_UUIS.json    -- document for Couch
   - ??.log          -- Log of running inspection-to-places lookups
- Clean up doc/dev/notes, there is old info in there now
- Write some usage docs in README.md
- It may be time to put info in changelog.md
- Need a new data structure for Couch combining all data from
  inspection and Places. Nested, with _id (inspection UUID we
  generate) and places_id at the top-level.
- Look into accessing CouchBase directly from Haskell
- Is there a different url encoding API than with Network.HTTP?
- In the Aeson FromJSON instances, do we really need these failParse
  functions? They have crazy type signatures, require KingSignatures
  and RandNTypes, and only do this: fail . show
- ks-inspections
   - Change the main.downloader implementation into a (Map String
     Downloader) so it can be used in usage output
   - Do proper usage output
- ks-location
   - Swap lookupEnv "HOME" for getHomeDirectory, it's less work!
   - Change the csv business (really in Ksdl.Match) to save out the
     JSON document for the db. For good AND bad, into different dirs
     (see above)
   - Determine if input path is a file or dir, do the appropriate
     thing
   - Do proper usage output
- Ksdl.Facility
   - Change this module name to Inspection
   - Rethink field names or start using this data type qualified
   - Should we really be using Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8
     saveFacility? Try with just Data.ByteString.Lazy or even
     not lazy.
   - Tighten up export list
- Ksdl.Inspection.*
   - Replace usage of Network.HTTP with Network.HTTP.Conduit
     (http-conduit). See Ksdl.Geocoding/Places
- Ksdl.Inspection.NcWake
   - Need to get more data from here for each inspection:
      - URL to individual inspection
      - Violations and critical violations
      - Whether it's an inspection or reinspection (maybe a Bool?)
- Ksdl.Places
   - Look for Places API key file in /etc/ as well as $HOME
