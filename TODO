- Look into accessing CouchBase directly from Haskell
- Replace usage of Network.HTTP with Network.HTTP.Conduit
  (http-conduit)
- Is there a different url encoding API than with Network.HTTP?
- ks-inspections
   - Change the main.downloader implementation into a (Map String
     Downloader) so it can be used in usage output
- ks-location
   - Clean up the error reporting formatting, particularly the
     missing Places results
   - Move Places API key loading code to Places module
   - Add a proper config file, possibly adding Reader monad to the
     base IO in place now.
- Ksdl.Facility
   - Generate deterministic UUIDs for these records (using UUID v4
     instead of v5). See the uuid-example project for help on this.
   - Rethink field names or start using this data type qualified
   - Should we really be using Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8
     saveFacility? Try with just Data.ByteString.Lazy or even
     not lazy.
   - Tighten up export list
- Ksdl.Places
   - Look for Places API key file in /etc/ as well as $HOME
