- Change the main.downloader implementation into a (Map String
  Downloader) so it can be used in usage output
- Look into accessing CouchBase directly from Haskell
- Generate deterministic UUIDs for these records (using UUID v4
  instead of v5). See the uuid-example project for help on this.
- Add a proper config file, possibly adding Reader monad to the
  base IO in place now.
- Look for Places API key file in /etc/ as well as $HOME
- Replace usage of Network.HTTP with Network.HTTP.Conduit (http-conduit)
- Is there a different url encoding API than with Network.HTTP?
- Rethink Facility field names or start using this data type qualified.
- Redesign Facility using Data.Text as with the Places module
- Possibly useful to make the Geocoding and Places monadic types
  (Either Text a) as opposed to (Either String a)?
- Clean up the error reporting formatting, particularly the missing Places results.
